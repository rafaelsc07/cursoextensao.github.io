## How do we live? What do we eat? What do we do?

Welcome to S4H X! Our Scrum Team works on maintaining 16 components for localization in Brazil. However, we also occasionally deal with issues related to Argentina, Peru, Mexico, Venezuela, and Chile. Additionally, we handle legal changes related to Brazil. When there are no legal changes to address, all developers on the team work on customer cases that come to us through Service Now.

Thus, in addition to keeping the S/4 HANA Cloud and On-Premise products updated in accordance with Brazilian laws, the team's goal is to assist customers with any potential issues that may arise in the system. We work optimally for the satisfaction and success of our customers.

!!! abstract
    The components **FI-LOC-TXS, FI-LOC-ISC-BR-OIL, FI-LOC-UT-BR** do not have Product Support assigned. So we are responsible for their primary support and development solutions if needed as well.

    Customer cases for **S/4HANA Public Cloud** systems (on any component that we handle) also are not handled by the Product Support and we have the accountability to be the primary support.
    
    ??? tip
        For both situations above it means that the reported cases don't have a pre-analysis and **THEY MAY NOT BE A REAL ISSUE**. It can be a simple configuration issue, or even errors with the tax calculation partner that may be handled by them (Avalara/TaxWeb...).
